# Introduction to Python
Welcome to Introduction to Python! In this lesson, you will learn the basics of what programming is, how to use Jupyter Notebooks, and Python basics. By the end of this lesson you should be able to.

- Explain what a programming language is
- Navigate a Jupyter Notebook
- Describe the difference between the most commmon types of data in Python
- Assign variables in Python

## What is Python? 

Python is a programming language that was first released in Feburary 1991. It is a **high-level programming language** that emphasizes readability. For this reason, many find Python to be an easier programming language to learn than other programming languages. The name Python, comes from the TV show, Monty Python.

Before we begin, let's first take a look at what programming is. **Programming** is the process of developing instructions (written in a programming language) for a computer to solve a problem or do a specific task. **Programming Languages** are "languages" that computers can interpret, there are *high-level programming languages* such as Javascript, C#, and Python, as well as *low-level programming languages* such as Machine Code and Assembly Lanugage. We won't get into low-level programming languages much in this lesson.

### Levels of Abstraction

One way to think about the difference between low and high level programming languages are the levels of abstraction. Low level programming languages are more directly controlling the machines. You may have heard that computers encode information as 1s and 0s, those 1s and 0s make up Machine Code, a low level programming language. Assembly Code directly manipulates those 1s and 0s and is easier to read, but still quite tricky.

The difficulty of reading and using low-level programming languages is why we have high-level languages. These programming languages look much closer to human language. This code is then translated to something that computers can understand. This takes more time and energy for the computer, but is often more efficient for the programmer.

Knowing the ins and outs of computer science is not required to do basic Python, but it can be helpful to remember the difference between high and low-level programming languages, especially as Generative AI becomes better at creating code. It's possible that we may start thinking of the ability to meaningfully prompt Gen AI tools for programming what you want as an even higher level of programming language.

## Downloading Python

There are several ways to download Python. This tutorial is going to use Anaconda, a distribution platform; however, you can also install it directly onto your computer using the official installer from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/). If you would rather install Python directly, you can use this [tutorial from Real Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

To install Python using Anaconda, all you'll need to do is install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). For detailed instructions on this, check out the [Anaconda documentation](/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#macos-linux-installation)

Once you've downloaded Anaconda, you can open it on your computer. You'll see a window that looks like this.

## Opening your first Jupyter Notebook

Now that you have the Anaconda window open, scrool down to Jupyter Notebook and click "Launch." A browser tab should open that lists your files. We recommend creating a new folder to hold your Jupyter Notebooks and other Python projects. You can do that by clicking the "New" button and selecting "Folder."

When you create and open your new folder, there will be nothing in it. While you can create a new Python notebook through clicking the "New" button, the rest of this tutorial will be found in an existing Python notebook in this GitHub repository. Go ahead and download the file in this repository named "python1.ipynb"

Once you've downloaded the file, move it to your newly created folder and refresh your browser tab. You should now see python1.ipynb. When you click on the file, it should open another tab.

## Explore Python

This concludes the installation and intro to your first Python lesson. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook for the rest of this lesson!
